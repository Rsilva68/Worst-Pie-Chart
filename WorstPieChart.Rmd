## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Libraries

library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(patchwork)

# create 3 data frame:
data1 <- data.frame( name=letters[1:5], value=c(17,18,20,22,24) )


# Plot

```{r PIE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data1, aes(x="name", y=value, fill=name)) + 
    geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
   coord_polar("y", start=0, direction = -1) +
     scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE,  direction=-1) + theme_void()
```  



``` {r Bar, echo=FALSE}
ggplot (data1) +
     geom_col(aes(y = value, x = name))
```
